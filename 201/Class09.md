# Forms and JS Events

##  FORMS

###   Whenever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
`<form>` element.

##  Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

###  Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.

###  HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

###  Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.

###  Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.

###  Lists: <br>

it allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point. <br>
**There are two types of lists;** unordered list/ ordered list. <br>
**list-style-image:** to add an image to your bullet point. <br>
**list-style-position:** specifies the position of the list-item markers (bullet points). <br>
**Tables Properties :** width, padding, text-transform[ to uppercase], letter-spacing, font-size, border-top, border-bottom, text-align, background-color, :hover [higlight a row]. empty-cells [show,hide], border-spacing [distance between cells]. <br>
**Cursor Styles:**  allows you to control the type of mouse cursor that should be displayed to users. <br>

##  Table

###  Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.

Events : <br>

An HTML event can be something the browser does or something a user does. <br>

**Here are some examples of HTML events:**
- An HTML web page has finished loading.
- An HTML input field was changed.
- An HTML button was clicked.

Often, when events happen, you may want to do something. <br>
JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected. <br>
HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements with **single or double quotes.** <br>

**Example of HTML Events :** <br>
**onchange :** An HTML element has been changed. <br>
**onclick :** The user clicks an HTML element. <br>
**onlouseover :** The user moves the mouse over an HTML element. <br>
**onmouseout :** The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element. <br>
**onkeydown :** The user pushes a keyboard key. <br>
**onload :** The browser has finished loading the page.

### * You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.

### * The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.
