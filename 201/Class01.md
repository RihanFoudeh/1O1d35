# Read: 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript
# HTML :
### WHAT HTML : HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. ‚Äè
### WHY HTML : you can define headers, paragraphs, links, images, and more, so your browser knows how to structure the web page you're looking at.
### HOW HTML : HTML elements consists of openning tag, closing tag, content and attributes.
### How the Web Works: When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the  world.
# Definitions list:
* HTML : HyperText Markup Language.
* CSS : (Cascading Style Sheets)is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers.
* web browser : is an application used to access and view websites. Common web browsers include Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome.
* HTML tags : are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags. When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right.
* HTML attributes : An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.
* class attribute : specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.
* Block Elements : Some elements will always  appear to start on a new line in  the browser window.ex ``` ( <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li> ) ```.
* Inline Elements : Some elements will always  appear to continue on the  same line as their neighbouring  elements.ex ``` ( <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img> ) ```.
* Semantic tag : can be used to define different parts of a web page.ex ```( <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <aside>, <section>, <figcaption>, <figure> ) ```.
# The main structure of html:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Defines the document type HTML5 -->
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta> <!-- Meta tags provide information about the webpage in the HTML of the document -->
            <title>This is the Title of the Page</title>
            <!-- Any linking pages and things that are not shown to the user -->
        </head>
        <style> <!-- CSS code -->
        <body>
            <!-- tags for all HTML elements that appear to the user -->
            <h1> <!-- header 1 -->
            .
            .
            <h6> <!-- to header 6 -->
            <p> <!-- paragraph -->
            <ol> <!-- ordered list -->
            <ul> <!-- unordered list -->
            <img> <!-- image -->
            <a> <!-- hyperlink -->
            <!-- -->  <!-- comment -->
            <div> <!-- allows you to group a set of elements together -->
            <iframe> <!-- window you  can see another page -->
            <script> <!-- javascript code -->
        </body>
    </html> 
```

# Planning before work :
### There are several requirements for every web developer to work on before they start writing the code:
* Knowing the end user of the page, what his interests are, and the services he needs.
* Distinguish his page from any page that resembles a page in performance so that there is a defense from the customer to use your pages and not any other page.
* Make sure to draw a blueprint for the page before you start implementing it.
* Ensure the consistency of the page and make the colors and design appropriate for the eyes and enthusiasm for the user when using.
* Make your site easy to use and beautiful in appearance.
* Dividing the page appropriately for each separate section and making sure that accessing any secondary page from the home page is easy for the user.
# Javascript :
### WHAT JavaScript : is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.
### WHY Javascript : convert a web page from static to dynamic.
### HOW Javascript : can add it to your code internally by using ``` <script> ``` tag or externlly file to link it.
# Definitions list:
* Script : element is used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code.
* Events : is an action that occurs as a result of the user or another source, such as a mouse click. An event handler is a routine that deals with the event, allowing a programmer to write code that will be executed when the event occurs.
* Objects : Objects exist to communicate. It is a common vocabulary for everyone involved in a project.
* Methods : allows the sending objects to invoke behaviors and to delegate the implementation of those behaviors to the receiving object.
# structure of Javascript :

```HTML

<Script>
    var // defines variable
    if (condition){} // if statement
    prompt() // user input
    alert() // output data
    document.write() // Writing in html
    // .... // comment
</Script> 

```
