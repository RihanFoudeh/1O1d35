## I have an idea of what's at this level:

* You'll have to research for hours on end, to figure out the skeleton we're discussing in class, and to compile information at the top of the app so you can reach your goals.
* You will be emotionally pushed, and you will constantly be faced with your lack of understanding of the topic.
* You will always have to figure out how to collaborate with new people and deal with their emotional quirks (and you).
* You will be constantly pushed away from your comfort zone with the expectation that you will survive the next push forward.
* You will constantly deal with the uncertainty of what awaits you at the end of the ten weeks, and whether or not you will succeed in it.
* You will be physically pushed, and while sitting in a chair and staring at your screen is not the most intense exercise in the world, the consecutive hours of it will take its toll.
* You will lose sleep, you will forget to exercise, and you will feel tired all the time as you are filled with information day in and day out.

## I understand that growth will not be easy but will come with pain, stress, challenge and fears.

## Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

## as i learn i have to ask my self some question  to give my self some feel good why i have this pressure and challenges:

* What’s your perspective?
* Why are you doing this?
* Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
* Are you doing this for you?

# A beginner's guide to Big O Notation

## Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used 

## types of Big 0 :

* O(1):describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

* O(N)" describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

* O(N²):represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set.

* O(2^N): denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically

## Logarithms used in computer imaging align pixels, organize colors and help computers manipulate photographs for enhancement, merging or comparison

### Among these algorithms: Binary search is a technique used to search in disaggregated data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, which is basically the median, and comparing it to the target value. If the values ​​match, success will return. If the target value is higher than the value of the probe element, it will take the upper half of the data set and perform the same operation against it. Similarly, if the target value is less than the value of the probe element, it will perform the operation against the lower half. It will keep halving the data set with each iteration until the value is found or until it can no longer split the data set.

### This type of algorithm is described as O (log N). Iterative halving of the data sets described in the binary search example results in a growth curve that peaks in the beginning and slowly flattens as the size of the data sets increases, for example. The input data set of 10 items takes one second to complete, the data set of 100 items takes two seconds, and the data set of 1000 items takes three seconds. Doubling the size of the input data set has little effect on its growth since after one iteration of the algorithm, the data set will be halved, thus on par with the input data set at half the size. This makes algorithms such as binary search very effective when dealing with large data sets.
