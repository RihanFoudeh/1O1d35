# linked Lists
What is linked lists?
Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are linked to each other.

Why using linked lists?
The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.


# Types of Linked List
Singly: there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

Doubly: there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

circular: it doesn't end with a node pointing to a null value. Instead, it has a node that acts as the tail of the list and the node after the tail node is the beginning of the list.



# Linear data structures
linear data structures, there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.
In non-linear data structures, items donâ€™t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.


# Big O
Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.
