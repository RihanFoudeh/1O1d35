# Read: 07 - Programming with JavaScript
### Control Flow Structures are an important aspect of programming languages that allow your code to take certain actions based on a variety of scenarios. Control Flow is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to dictate how your code runs under different conditions or until a certain condition is met.

### I find when I talk to newbie programmers, the importance of Control Flow Structures is often lost. A newbie programmer will want to replicate the functionality of Facebook or Twitter because they can only see the surface of what is going on. Control Flow Structures can seem a little bit abstract when you first start learning about them, but it is critical to understand the power of them.

### This tutorial will focus on the most common Control Flow Structures you will encounter in Javascript. Control Flow is an important concept to learn in all programming languages, so the theory carries across multiple languages.
