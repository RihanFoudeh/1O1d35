# Features
### Technically, a remote repository doesn't differ from a local one: it contains branches, commits, and tags just like a local repository. However, a local repository has a working copy associated with it: a directory where some version of your project's files is checked out for you to work with.
### A remote repository doesn't have such a working directory: it only consists of the bare ".git" repository folder.
