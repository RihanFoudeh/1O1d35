# Read: 03 - Structure web pages with HTML
## There are several requirements for every web developer to work on before they start writing the code:

+ Knowing the end user of the page, what his interests are, and the services he needs.

+ Distinguish his page from any page that resembles a page in performance so that there is a defense from the customer to use your pages and not any other page.

+ Make sure to draw a blueprint for the page before you start implementing it.

+ Ensure the consistency of the page and make the colors and design appropriate for the eyes and enthusiasm for the user when using.

+ Make your site easy to use and beautiful in appearance.

+ Dividing the page appropriately for each separate section and making sure that accessing any secondary page from the home page is easy for the user.

## There are many tags that help to divide the page and divide it into parts to facilitate its construction and ease of use. Anyone may see the source code.

## Especially since HTML 5 has many more features in it than before.
## There are many tags like (text, image, video, Navbar, Footer, img, H1, P, iframe , div , ... ).
## Also, comments can be added within the source code for those who may be able to view them, for example if you are working with a team or you can provide yourself with any memory of how to do something or its function, and of course these comments cannot be seen on the web.
