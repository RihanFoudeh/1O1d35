# Read: 05 - Operators and Loops
## We can return a true or false logical result through: comparison operators such as
+ is equal to “ == “
+ is not equal to “ != “
+ strict equal to “ === “
+ strict not equal “ !== “
+ greater than “ > “
+ less than “ < “
+ greater than or equal to “ >= “
+ less than or equal to “ <= “
# There are also many more operators to compare the result: logical operators:
+ AND “ && “
+ OR “	 	”
+ NOT “ ! “
## Loops are a programming element that repeat a portion of code a set number of times until the desired process is complete. Repetitive tasks are common in programming, and loops are essential to save time and minimize errors. There are several types:
+ FOR
+ WHILE
+ DO WHILE
## All kinds of loops sentences contain three important things:
+ INDITIALIZATION : Create a val and set it to 0
+ CONDITION
+ UPDATE
